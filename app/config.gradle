// This APPropriate proof of concept uses an appropriated wireless USB drive (Verbatim MediaShare Wireless Mini) to
// provide its functionality. As a result, it needs to use simple password-based login, and a network naming scheme
// based on a hash of the PIN to ensure a basic level of security.
//
// To build your own APPropriate, set your own passwords here, and on the USB drive. Avoid making these values public.
//
// Better still, lobby device manufacturers to incorporate this type of local cloud functionality into their own
// devices, with proper security features, so workarounds like this are not needed.
